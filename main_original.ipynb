    "This notebook explores the fascinating domain of text generation using a deep learning model trained on Shakespeare's sonnets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to create a neural network capable of generating text sequences that mimic the style and language of Shakespeare.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, this project aims to demonstrate how a model can learn and replicate the complex patterns of early modern English. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used consists of Shakespeare's sonnets, which are preprocessed and tokenized to serve as input for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, you will see the steps taken to prepare the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance in generating text. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of natural language processing (NLP) and the potential of machine learning in creative text generation."
